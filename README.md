# Guessing-Game
This is a simple python game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100, and the computer prompts them to guess higher or lower until they get it! 
I used this project to learn how to 
- create and recall a function
- Use a while True loop
- Use a try suite
- And put it all together into a fun well known game!
